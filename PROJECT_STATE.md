# PROJECT_STATE

Living build log for **miniVERL** (`mini-verl` / `miniverl` / CLI `miniverl`).
A checkbox is not evidence: every completed item names the command that was run
and what it printed.

Last updated: 2026-07-27.

## Current phase

Phase 6 -- release quality. Phases 1-5 (numerics, environments and toy backend,
Hugging Face + QLoRA backend, CLI and reports, benchmarks) are implemented and
covered by executed tests. Remaining work is listed under
[Next three actions](#next-three-actions).

## Environment (measured, not assumed)

| item | value | how |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OS | Windows 11 Pro 10.0.22631 | `platform.platform()` |
| GPU | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080, 16376 MiB, driver 596.49 | `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,memory.total,driver_version` |
| dev interpreter | CPython 3.12.13 (`.venv`, uv-managed) | `uv venv --python 3.12` |
| torch | 2.13.0+cu130, `torch.cuda.is_available() == True` | `python -c "import torch; ..."` |
| transformers | 5.14.1 | `importlib.metadata.version` |
| peft | 0.19.1 | idem |
| bitsandbytes | 0.50.0, `bnb.nn.Linear4bit` present | idem |
| PyPI name `miniverl` | AVAILABLE (HTTP 404 on `/pypi/miniverl/json`, 2026-07-27) | `Invoke-WebRequest` |

## Verified model pair (pinned in the recipes)

Confirmed twice against `huggingface.co/api/models/...` with a negative control
(an all-zero SHA returns 404, so the endpoint really validates revisions):

| role | model | revision | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| student | `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` | `c1899de289a04d12100db370d81485cdf75e47ca` | Apache-2.0, 28 layers, hidden 1024 |
| teacher | `Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B` | `70d244cc86ccca08cf5af4e1e306ecf908b1ad5e` | Apache-2.0, 28 layers, hidden 2048 |

`tokenizer.json` is byte-identical across the pair
(sha256 `aeb13307a71acd8fe81861d94ad54ab689df773318809eed3cbe794b4492dae4`).
`config.vocab_size` is 151936 while `len(tokenizer)` is 151669 -- the vocabulary
is padded. miniVERL sizes the cache and `top_k` from the model's output
dimension, never from the tokenizer; a GPU test asserts both numbers.

## Release gates (all executed on 2026-07-27)

| gate | command | result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lint | `ruff check .` | **clean** |
| format | `ruff format --check .` | **clean, 133 files** |
| types | `mypy src/miniverl` | **clean, 71 source files** |
| tests | `pytest -q -m "not gpu and not network" --cov=miniverl` | **929 passed, 4 deselected, 85% branch coverage** over 5855 statements |
| GPU tests | `pytest -q -m gpu` | **4 passed** |
| build | `python -m build` | sdist + wheel built |
| metadata | `python -m twine check dist/*` | **PASSED** for both |
| wheel completeness | enumerate `src/miniverl` against the wheel | all 77 entries present |
| clean install (core) | wheel into a fresh venv | `--help`, `--version`, `doctor --json` work; torch absent |
| clean install (train) | wheel + `[train]` into a second fresh venv | `miniverl demo --fast` completes and writes `report.html` |
| unfinished markers | `rg "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX\|HACK\|NotImplementedError" src tests examples scripts` | none |

## Completed, with evidence

### Numerical core

* `tests/unit/test_losses_exact.py` -- **21 passed**. Brute-force Python
  references for forward KL, reverse KL and beta-JSD; an orientation test that
  catches an accidental KL reversal; the `log 2` bound on symmetric JSD;
  finiteness at logit scale 1e4; finite gradients; fp16/bf16 upcast; the `T^2`
  contract.
* `tests/unit/test_losses_bucketed.py` -- **30 passed**. `log1mexp` against a
  reference; tail-mass validity; `k == V` converging to the exact loss;
  the data-processing-inequality bound for k in {1,2,8,32} across all three
  divergences; monotonicity in k; a bounded reverse-KL tail penalty.
* `tests/unit/test_chunked_equivalence.py` -- **22 passed**. The two-stage
  detach/backward reproduces the unchunked **gradient** for chunk sizes 1, 5 and
  37 across all three divergences; zero-weight positions provably contribute
  nothing; CE mixing is convex; `loss_scale` affects gradients only.
* `tests/property/` -- **14 passed** under Hypothesis, including the
  data-processing inequality evaluated in float64 to `1e-9`.

### Provenance and alignment

* `tests/unit/test_token_provenance.py` -- **30 passed**. A mask that marks a
  `tool_result` token trainable is rejected; spans must tile the sequence;
  position 0 can never be a target; privileged-context alignment computes
  per-segment offsets and rejects a target-token mismatch, a length-changed
  segment, a missing segment, a duplicate key and a tokenizer mismatch.

### Environments

Oracle solves **6/6** train tasks for every (environment, difficulty) pair;
train/eval/test prompt sets are pairwise disjoint. SQLite lockdown, all
**BLOCKED**: `DROP`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `ATTACH`, `PRAGMA`,
`SELECT * FROM sqlite_master` (authorizer), `SELECT randomblob(10)` (function
whitelist), two statements in one call.

### End-to-end

* `tests/integration/test_toy_pipeline.py` -- SFT, offline KD and OPD each run
  to completion and write every documented artifact; OPD increments its policy
  version once per cycle; offline KD announces that it is reusing fixed targets;
  no stored trajectory ever marks tool output trainable.
* `tests/integration/test_resume_and_swap.py` -- an interrupted-and-resumed run
  matches an uninterrupted one to `1e-6` parameter-for-parameter; `swap` matches
  `resident` to the same tolerance; checkpoints contain no pickle; the OOM retry
  only halves the chunk and gives up with actionable advice.
* `tests/integration/test_hf_backend_offline.py` -- a real `Qwen3ForCausalLM`
  built from a config (no download): adapter resolution through PEFT,
  selected-position projection matching a full forward to `1e-4`, KV-cache
  generation matching a cacheless reference token for token, and gradients
  reaching **only** the LoRA tensors.

### Real hardware

* **Full recipe**, `recipes/qwen_consumer_gpu_calc.yaml`, run id
  `rtx4080-calc-opd`: 16 optimizer steps in **481.1 s**; held-out greedy success
  **0.0% -> 100.0%** on 12 tasks. The 8-cycle SFT cold start did most of that:
  the first OPD rollout batch already scored 83.3%.
* **One-cycle smoke**: peak **4.251 GiB allocated / 4.762 GiB reserved**;
  strategy resolved to `resident` because a quantized model cannot be moved off
  the accelerator; projection chunk 256; 0 OOM retries; student 10,092,544
  trainable LoRA parameters; teacher 1,720,574,976 parameters.
* **Throughput probe**: NF4 11.19 tok/s, bf16 LoRA 12.84 tok/s (14.12 with
  determinism off). A 14-token prefill costs 37.0 ms and a cached one-token step
  costs 30.9 ms, so decoding here is **kernel-launch bound, not compute bound**.
* **Matched-budget GPU benchmark** (`benchmarks/configs/gpu_calc_hard.yaml`,
  chained calculator split, single seed): see
  `docs/rtx4080-baselines.md`. First run: cold start 62.5%, continued SFT 100%,
  OPD against the raw instruct teacher **0.0%** with the objective falling 2.33
  -> 0.84 throughout. A privileged-context arm was added to test the reading
  that the teacher, never having seen the tool protocol, was actively
  mis-teaching; that run is recorded in the same file.

### Defects found and fixed during the build

Recorded because each one is a class of bug worth remembering.

| defect | how it was found | fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/miniverl/models/` excluded from git **and** the wheel by an unanchored `models/` rule in `.gitignore` | installing the wheel into a clean venv | anchored every directory rule; CI now enumerates the source tree against the wheel and fails on any git-ignored source file |
| Rich markup ate `[...]`, so the missing-extra hint printed `pip install "miniverl"` | reading actual CLI output | every dynamic string goes through `rich.markup.escape` |
| A bare install raised `ModuleNotFoundError` instead of naming the extra | a CLI test | the scorer import moved inside the constructor; the CLI pre-checks the stack |
| `exact_full_vocab` rejected a recipe that omitted `top_k` -- the remedy its own error suggested -- and then wrote a `config.resolved.yaml` that could not be re-read | an agent-written config test | consult `model_fields_set`, then normalize to 1 |
| `weighted_mean` rescaled the result for a tiny-but-positive weight sum | Hypothesis | floor only an exactly-zero sum |
| `EnvironmentConfig.name` was a hard-coded regex, making `register()` useless | writing the custom-environment example | validate against the registry |
| `render_final` could emit a block that parsed back truncated | an agent-written protocol test | escape closing tags in JSON, refuse them in plain text |
| `configure_logging(None)` silently downgraded `--log-level DEBUG` | an agent-written utils test | only an explicit level changes the level |
| The report dropped stored rollouts and printed `0.000 GiB` for CPU runs on a GPU machine | an agent-written reporting test | fill the display budget; decide on the run's device |
| Sampling drew from a CUDA tensor with a CPU generator | the first GPU smoke test | always draw on the CPU, which also makes a seed reproduce across devices |
| Resume replayed completed cycles with a different LR schedule | the resume-equivalence test | `train()` continues at the checkpointed cycle; the teacher fit is wrapped in `fork_rng` |
| The toy model could not learn to copy | measuring, not assuming | learned absolute positions -> RoPE; 48 traces -> 256 traces |

## Currently failing commands

None. Every gate in the table above passes.

## Unresolved design risks

1. **The teacher is not taught the protocol.** The GPU benchmark shows that
   distilling a protocol-cold-started student toward a raw instruct teacher can
   *reduce* task success while the objective improves. This is a property of the
   setup, not a bug, but the recipes must not imply otherwise, and
   `docs/limitations.md` says so.
2. **The toy backend cannot rank methods.** It solves only the `easy` split,
   where SFT saturates. Measured: `medium` and `hard` stay at 0% even after 700
   SFT steps. The CPU benchmark is therefore a parity check, not a ranking.
3. **Single-seed GPU results.** Two seeds on CPU, one on GPU. No significance is
   claimed anywhere.
4. **transformers 5.x API drift.** The dtype keyword is chosen by version
   comparison with an introspection fallback; a future rename would need a new
   branch.

## Next three actions

1. Finish `docs/rtx4080-baselines.md` with the second GPU benchmark (the
   privileged-context arm) and copy both result JSON files into
   `benchmarks/results/`.
2. Re-run the CPU matched benchmark with a constant, lower arm learning rate
   (the first attempt restarted the cosine schedule at the base rate and damaged
   every arm), and record both attempts.
3. Run the final audit loop: scientific, ML-systems, OSS-maintainer,
   adversarial-newcomer and security.

## External blockers

* **Publishing to PyPI.** Requires a maintainer to register a trusted publisher
  in the PyPI project settings. No credentials exist in this environment, so no
  upload was attempted. The exact steps are in `docs/release-checklist.md`; the
  release workflow validates and builds but deliberately does not upload.
* **Pushing to GitHub / creating a release.** No push was attempted; the
  repository is a local git checkout with all work committed.
* **A GPU CI runner.** `.github/workflows/gpu.yml` is manual-dispatch only and
  targets a self-hosted `cuda` runner that does not exist for this repository.
  The GPU tests were instead executed locally on the RTX 4080; results above.

## Final evidence table

See [Release gates](#release-gates-all-executed-on-2026-07-27) above; that table
is the evidence table. Known limitations are enumerated in
`docs/limitations.md`, which is written to be read before the README's results
section rather than after it.
